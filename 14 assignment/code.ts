//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.


let guestList: string[]= ['Adeeba: ','Sara: ','Fazila: ','Aqsa: '];
let message: string= ('Hi!! i am planning a dinner tommorow at "ClockTower". So i would really like if you will come and join it. "T H A N K Y O U !!"');
for(let i=0; i<guestList.length; i++){
    console.log( guestList[i] + message );
}
